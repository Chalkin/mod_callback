# Joomla callback module
This is a simple Joomla module which displays a modal form for customers to request a callback.

#Current state
This is the current state right after the first push - converted from a customer project.
So please be aware that it's current state only works for a Joomla 3 installation with Bootstrap 3 in use.
In the future it will be converted and features will be added to match the needs of a community module.

#Constributing
Your contributions are more than welcome! Please make all pull requests against the develop branch.
